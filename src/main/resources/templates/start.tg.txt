Hello ğŸ”¥ *%s* ğŸ”¥,
I'm `Djinny` ğŸª”, a wish list bot!

- tell me your wishes, and I'll keep them for you
- share them with everyone by making them public
- find what other people want by searching their public wishes

Go ahead and try to /create one and then /list.

The most convenient way to interact with me is via WebApp, you'll find the button after running the /list command.

So don't wait and /create your first wish, and maybe soon it will come true!
