# Wishlist Bot (TWA)

## The problem

- I want to share my wishlist with friends, so that they know what to give me for a birthday
- I want to know what to give for a birthday/Xmas/New Year/... to my friends
- Sometimes I need an inspiration, I'd like to peek into wishes of others
- A tool for donating to a particular wish of a popular person

## The solution

A Telegram bot with TWA allowing users to keep track of their wishlist, share with others, searching for public items of other users.

## User stories

- [US-010] User can add a wish list item
	- [US-011] User can copy-paste a URL of an item and the information should be pre-populated
- [US-020] User can view the list of his own items
- [US-030] User can view the details of his particular item
- [US-040] User can make an item public or private
- [US-050] User can find public items of their users by their name
- [US-060] User can see an "explore page" - public feed of items of all users
- [US-070] User can search/filter items by tags
- [US-080] User can control privacy of his profile
	- [US-081] Show/hide avatar image
	- [US-082] Show/hide Telegram username, keep just a name, override visible name
- [US-090] User can set shipping address in his account
- [US-100] User get badges for accomplishing certain goals (first public item, X wishes achieved, ...)
- [US-110] User can buy an item directly from the Bot
  - [US-115] User can book or reserve a wish (e.g. to buy as a gift)
  - [US-116] Wish booking can be public or private (reveal user's name)
- [US-120] User can donate/buy a public wish of another user

## TBD
- An Item can have tags, categories
- A user can get inspired by someone's wish and add it to his own list
- A user can like/comment on someone's public item (e.g. ask where to buy)
- A user can follow another user and receive updates on someone else's list
