# Wishlist Bot (TWA)

## The problem

- I want to share my wishlist with friends, so that they know what to give me for a birthday
- I want to know what to give for a birthday/Xmas/New Year/... to my friends
- Sometimes I need an inspiration, I'd like to peek into wishes of others
- A tool for donating to a particular wish of a popular person

## The solution
